#Cura Dremel 3D20 Marlin
This is a set of definition files for Cura that are optimized for the Dremel 3D20 when it is flashed with the Marlin firmware (https://github.com/moonglow/FlashForge_Marlin)

Much of this is based on the work of Tim Schoenmackers (https://github.com/timmehtimmeh) and his definition files bundled with his Dremel Plugin for Cura.

I have tried to optimize the settings based on my Simplify3D settings and trial and error when using Cura with a 3D20 flashed with Marlin.
