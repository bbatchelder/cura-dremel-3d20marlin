# Cura Dremel 3D20 Marlin
This is a set of Machine Profile for Cura that is optimized for the Dremel 3D20 when it is flashed with the Marlin firmware (https://github.com/moonglow/FlashForge_Marlin)

Much of this is based on the work of Tim Schoenmackers (https://github.com/timmehtimmeh) and his definition files bundled with his Dremel Plugin for Cura that allows Cura to work with a stock 3D20.

I have tried to optimize the settings based on my Simplify3D settings and trial and error when using Cura with a 3D20 flashed with Marlin.

# Installation
Copy these files into your Cura settings location.  On macOS that is ~Library/Application Support/cura/<version>/

Then open Cura, add a printer, and pick Dremel / Dremel 3D20 with Marlin Firmware
